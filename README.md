# Indian Agriculture Data Visualization

This project visualizes agricultural data in India through a bar chart and a table. It fetches data from a local JSON file, processes it, and displays the results in a table and bar chart format. The chart shows the average yield of various crops, and the table provides the maximum and minimum crop productions by year.
